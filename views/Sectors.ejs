                One of the primary forces behind industrialization has been the use of metals. Steel has traditionally occupied a top spot among metals. Steel production and consumption are frequently seen as measures of a country's economic development because it is both a raw material and an intermediary product. Therefore, it would not be an exaggeration to argue that the steel sector has always been at the forefront of industrial progress and that it is the foundation of any economy. The Indian steel industry is classified into three categories - major producers, main producers, and secondary producers. <br>
India is the world’s second-largest producer of crude steel, with an output of 125.32 MT of crude steel and finished steel production of 121.29 MT in FY23. India’s domestic steel demand is estimated to grow by 9-10% in FY25 as per ICRA. India’s steel production is estimated to grow 4-7% to 123-127 MT in FY24. The growth in the Indian steel sector has been driven by the domestic availability of raw materials such as iron ore and cost-effective labour.

               According to Crisil Ratings, the organized retail apparel sector is projected to achieve revenue growth of 8-10% in the current financial year, driven by rising demand from a normal monsoon, easing inflation, and the festive and wedding seasons. The increasing preference for affordable, trendy fashion clothing that mimics high-fashion designs is expected to be the primary revenue driver this fiscal year. <br>
India’s textiles sector is one of the oldest industries in the Indian economy, dating back to several centuries. The industry is extremely varied, with hand-spun and hand-woven textiles sectors at one end of the spectrum, with the capital-intensive sophisticated mills sector at the other end. The fundamental strength of the textile industry in India is its strong production base of a wide range of fibre/yarns from natural fibres like cotton, jute, silk, and wool, to synthetic/man-made fibres like polyester, viscose, nylon and acrylic. <br>
The decentralised power looms/ hosiery and knitting sector form the largest component of the textiles sector. The close linkage of textiles industry to agriculture (for raw materials such as cotton) and the ancient culture and traditions of the country in terms of textiles makes it unique in comparison to other industries in the country.
India’s textiles industry has a capacity to produce a wide variety of products suitable for different market segments, both within India and across the world. In order to attract private equity and employee more people, the government introduced various schemes such as the Scheme for Integrated Textile Parks (SITP), Technology Upgradation Fund Scheme (TUFS) and Mega Integrated Textile Region and Apparel (MITRA) Park scheme.
